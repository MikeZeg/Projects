### Extra repo dedicated to my personal projects.

I will add my own small projects or courses to that repository as I learn new technologies.

#### CRUD - learn Create, Read, Updata, Delete

I worked on a small project to learn how CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations function and how to connect an application to a database- FireBase.

#### TCL Structures

The website project for the small company began to reveal differences between the current multi-page design and a single-page website approach.

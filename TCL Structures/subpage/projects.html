                            The project involved constructing a 19-floor reinforced concrete office development in central Birmingham.
                            This included pouring concrete topping over metal decking to form the floors. 
                            Other associated works were casting high-level upstands and plinths, as well as structural steel plates for the building's three cores.

                            <br>This was a very tight project situated in the heart of Birmingham city center. 
                            Concrete was poured twice a week, with approximately 250 cubic meters poured per session. A static pump was set up on the ground floor in the limited space provided by BAM.

                            <br>A temporary concrete pipeline was installed vertically through the building's main core. 
                            Loading out the roughly 220 sheets of mesh per floor was especially challenging. The team worked closely with Severfield (the steel frame contractor) to coordinate lifts for loading materials and the ongoing construction of the main building frame.
